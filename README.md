# google_apis
This repository is used to contain all of the edited versions of the Google Maps APIs (eg Google Distance Matrix, Geocoding, etc) tailored for my individual projects. Data is stored locally, so must pay attention to how to parse the inputted data for generalizability.
Also doubles as pratice for using GitHub.
