# google_apis
This repository is used to contain all of the edited versions of the Google Maps APIs (eg Google Distance Matrix, Geocoding, etc) tailored for my individual projects. Data is stored locally, so must pay attention to how to parse the inputted data for generalizability.
Also doubles as pratice for using GitHub.

Currently there are two different APIs in use: the reverse geocoder and the distance matrix. The reverse geocoder takes in the latitude 
and longitudes and returns the state (if in the US) of the location. The distance matrix takes in the lat and long and returns the 
distnace of all possible comibinations of starting and ending.
